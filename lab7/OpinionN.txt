My stay at this hotel was quite disappointing. From the beginning, I noticed that the front desk staff was nasty,
seeming disinterested in addressing my needs. Upon entering the room, I observed that the cleanliness left
much to be desired. The furniture appeared worn, and the carpet seemed like it hadn't been vacuumed in quite some time.
The hotel restaurant was also a letdown. The meals were disgusting, and the service was incompetent. There were instances
where my orders were inaccurately prepared, negatively impacting the overall dining experience. Additionally, the noise
from the nearby street was quite bothersome, making it difficult for me to get a good night's sleep.
I understand that every hotel may have its imperfections, but unfortunately, in this case, there were too many to overlook.
I hope the management takes note of these issues and takes steps to improve the quality of the services provided.
